<h4>Things to Explore</h4>
I've recently become a lot more interested in low-level programming of various sorts, primarily in operating systems and programming languages. I'm also interested in learning a lot more about computer architecture in order to better understand operating systems. I have written (an extremely un-optimized) processor in Verilog back in 2018 and also programmed the processor a bit with RISC-V assembly, so I have a bit of experience with computer architecture but not anything too recent I
guess
<br/>
I also recently switched from Atom to Vim (which was surprisingly smooth) and I'm trying to learn how to LaTeX things super fast in Vim, which seems potentially useful for my thesis and also like a weird nerd flex

<h4> Summer Plans </h4>
Other than traveling a bit to see family, I mostly plan to work on my thesis and write papers this summer, but I'm also hoping to work through a linear algebra course. I'm torn between following 18.700 (probably on OCW) and following Pablo Parrilo's linear algebra and optimization class. The linear algebra and optimization class is a good deal more applied and so maybe more directly relevant to research, but 18.700 would probably be more useful for taking 6.867 in the fall 
<br/>
I'm very excited for the summer to actually start -- I'm done with classes but have one final in the second-to-last finals block and so I feel like I'm in a purgatory between the semester and the summer. I just feel like summer is a much more relaxing and research-productive time than the school year, but last summer was both kind of stressful and kind of unproductive for me, so maybe that's not actually true

<h4> Things I've Been Thinking About </h4>
I've been thinking recently about the value of hard things. I don't think difficulty is inherently correlated with value, but I often find myself doing things that are easy but not particularly important/valuable, and often end up getting a lot of mileage out of hard things (presumably because I'm too lazy to do anything that's hard but unimportant/not valuable). So I want to be more intentional about working on problems or subproblems that are hard but important
<br/>
I also think there's something to be said for like "MIT is hard and valuable", but I don't think MIT is valuable because of its difficulty or really in spite of its difficulty
