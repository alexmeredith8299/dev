One of my goals for summer and fall 2022 is to work on my master's thesis at least five days each week (with a week defined as Monday-Sunday). I'm also hoping to blog or journal at least five days each week, preferably the same five days as I work on my thesis -- I might keep some of this writing private but I'm hoping to post most of it here for "accountability" even though I am likely the only person who will read/see these posts

Most of the posts will probably be pretty short and relatively incoherent but that's ok, as the goal isn't actually to produce good posts. The goal is just to write regularly and get back into blogging enough that I might occasionally write good posts
