<h4> End of the Academic Year </h4>
The school year isn't really over -- I still have one more final. But it practically feels over. I've been reflecting on the past year a bit, and I think things went fairly well overall. My fellowship applications went better than I could have hoped, and I think I did really good work in 6.832 this semester (...which will hopefully lead to something publishable). But I still feel like I let myself down in some ways. I wanted to turn in my thesis this semester, and I still basically
haven't started, which is fine but not what I had intended. I also still need at least one more quals class and I was hoping to be done with quals by now. I definitely don't want to speedrun the PhD, but I was hoping to kind of speedrun to the point in the PhD program where you just do research, and that didn't really happen.

I guess I don't really have coherent thoughts here yet. I just have a sense that I could have done better, but also that many things turned out better than I had hoped
