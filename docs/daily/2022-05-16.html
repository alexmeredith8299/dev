<h4> Finals </h4>
I definitely still feel stuck in a weird limbo where I have one more final, but I'm mostly done studying for it. I'll probably try to study a bit more, but it feels weird to work on other things and yet it also feels weird to do more studying that isn't really urgent. I'm also waiting on my new research laptop, and I feel in limbo there as well -- there's a certain experiment that I want to run on the new laptop but obviously I can't do that yet

I guess this is consistent with my experience that in grad school, some days, weeks, and seasons are slow-paced and others are fast-paced. But this doesn't feel like a vacation, because I have a final in two days. I also sometimes find the "slow" times stressful because I dread things speeding up again; I'd like to get better at just enjoying the slow days as they happen. This is one of the harder parts of grad school work-life balance for me. I wish I had more control over when my workload
gets light and when it gets heavy, but it mostly comes down to deadlines that are completely out of my control
<h4> Difficulty =/= Value </h4>
I'm still trying to wrap my brain around the "sometimes hard things are worth doing but that doesn't mean that difficulty makes something inherently valuable" concept that I've been thinking about recently. I think there's probably a whole real blog post (or multiple posts?) there about how MIT is hard, and the difficulty makes you grow, and I've found the growth worthwhile, but growth for the sake of growth is stupid. There's probably several points to be made there as well about things that
don't scale or shouldn't scale (i.e. conventional startup wisdom is to grow indefinitely, but sometimes a small stable company is better). In a semi-similar vein, I don't think that doing hard things for the sake of difficulty is useful, except maybe as a flex. Sometimes places like MIT hurt you, and the growth isn't worth it for everyone. I do think it's been worth it for me, though
